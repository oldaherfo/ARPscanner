#ARP Scanner Tool:
#Warning
**The use of this tool is solely for educational and testing purposes. It should not be used on networks or systems without the explicit permission of the owner.**

This is a simple ARP scanning tool built in Python and Tkinter for the graphical interface. It scans a range of IP addresses and displays the MAC addresses and associated vendors.

#Features:
-Graphical interface built with Tkinter
-IP address scanning
-MAC address vendor identification
-Simple and lightweight

#Requirements:
This project requires Python and the following libraries:
-scapy
-requests
-tkinter

#How to Use:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the file ARPscanner.py.
4. Enter the IP range to scan (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) in the input field.
5. Click on "Start Scan" to initiate the scan.

Program Execution:
python ARPscanner.py

I have also provided an executable file "ARPscanner.exe" so you can try the program without installing any dependencies in Windows environments.

Make sure you have the necessary permissions and are testing in an authorized environment. ARP spoofing can disrupt network communication.
